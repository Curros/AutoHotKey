This is my collection of AutoHotKey (AHK) scripts. For more information on AHK
see [the AutoHotKey website](http://www.autohotkey.com/).

Scripts:

* **Aim-Fire.ahk** - A script by me for combining aim & fire in Call of Duty games
* **COD-Toolbox.ahk** - A script by zygorator for automating some things in Call of Duty games
* **DisableTouchPad.ahk** - For use on laptops with a touchpad, it will disable the touchpad for 0.5sec after you type any key. Great if, like me, you accidentally touch it while typing.
* **MouseClicker.ahk** - Used to automate long repetitive actions, e.g. crafting in WoW
* **PushToTalk.ahk** - Push the button to open the mic, release it to mute.
* **ResizeWindow.ahk** - Quick little hack script for sizing windows to certain sizes.
* **Shortcuts.ahk** - My main personal scripts file. Contains all kind of little shortcuts I use every day.
* **SoundCardAnalysis.ahk** - Displays your sound capabilities, devices, etc. (From the AHK SoundSet documentation)
* **SpamButton.ahk** - Used for games like WoW, to spam the main action bar buttons 10 times per second
* **ToggleMic.ahk** - Toggles the mic mute when mouse button 4 is pressed.

Disclaimer: I did not write all these scripts. Many were collected from forum posts or other sources and are simply here so I don't lose them.
