This is my collection of AutoHotKey (AHK) scripts. For more information on AHK
see [the AutoHotKey website](http://www.autohotkey.com/).

Scripts:
* *DisableTouchPad.ahk* - For use on laptops with a touchpad, it will disable the touchpad for 0.5sec after you type any key. Great if, like me, you accidentally touch it while typing.
* *PushToTalk.ahk* - Push the button to open the mic, release it to mute.
* *QuickConsole.ahk* - Used with Console.exe to make a Quake-like popup console
* *Shortcuts.ahk* - My main personal scripts file. Contains all kind of little shortcuts I use every day.

Disclaimer: I did not write all these scripts. Many were collected from forum posts or other sources and are simply here so I don't lose them.
